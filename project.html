<p>
This is the first step in our hiring process: You will find two projects below, please select one and implement it 
with best of your capabilities. Please add in the README of the project "why" you selected the project.
</p>

<h3>Project 1: Timeclock</h3>

<p>
This project is to create a realtime time tracking application using Rails. 

The worker should be able to go to the home page click on "Register" link to open up registeration form to create profile. 
Worker profile has name and date of birth as fields. Completing the registration form will provide the worker with a id. 

The home page should also have link to the Timeclock which when clicked takes the worker to a view which will display a 
form field for ID, "Punch In" button which when pressed will start the timer and display a 
"Punch Out" button to stop the timer. The worker will also be able to see the total time that has been logged. 

The homepage should have a link for manager view which when clicked will open it up (no id or authentication required) 
and will display all the workers in a list. The list item will show worker name, date of birth, id, total time, 
and the worker status (active or inactive) active green background, inactive has red background. 

Please don't hesitate to ask questions, to clarify the requirements.

Please use github as source code repo and to build the project, so that history of commits can be viewed. 
Add a README to describe how to install the application, and any comments on future updates. Bonus host the application 
online and add the link to it in the README.
</p>

<h3>Project 2: Variance</h3>

<p>
You may choose to do this project instead of the Timeclock one.

This project involves creating a Rails based API, the API exposes following endpoints

Schema of dataset 
{
  id: Integer,
  temperature: Float (minimum value can be -273.15)
  recorded_at: Datetime (UTC)
}

GET /datasets
List of all datasets

GET /datasets/:id
Respond with a dataset as json

POST /datasets
Create a dataset in the database and respond with dataset created as json

PUT /datasets/:id
Update a dataset in the database and respond with updated dataset

DELETE /datasets/:id
Delete a dataset and respond with deleted dataset

Use HTTP status codes to communicate the status of all operatures, e.g. 200 for success and 400 for failure, 404 for not 
found etc.

GET /variance
Respond with variance of temperature over last minute
Reference on how to calculate variance:
https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/statistics/variance-calculator.php

Assume the frequency of data collection is 10 records / second

The client of the API, should use a token for verification in the header, for this project you can seed the 
database with tokens using a token model.

Please don't hesitate to ask questions, to clarify the requirements.

Please use github as source code repo and to build the project, so that history of commits can be viewed. 
Add a README to describe how to install the application, and any comments on future updates. Bonus, host the application 
online and add the link to it in the README.
